- Linear Algebra Library -
Started as a way to help me take notes, this evolved into an advanced Linear Algebra library to handle Matrices, Bases, and Vectors. While some features, such as going to Reduced Row Echelon Form, appending Vectors to Matrices as a row or a column, going back and forth between Matrices and Bases, finding determinants and inverses, and much more, are very securely and thoroughly coded, there are also some slightly more experimental features that are much more computationally difficult, such as finding the eigenvectors of a Matrix. I placed a heavy emphasis on ease of defining vectors/matrices through string initialization and ease in terms of use of operators (+, -, ||, &&, !, etc) for the sake of shortening code written to accomplish specific computational tasks.
